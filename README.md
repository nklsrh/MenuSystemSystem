# MenuSystemSystem
My personal Menu UI System and Controller that I used across all my Unity mobile (and PC) games


It does:
* Menus
* Popups
* Main Controller logic for gameplay flow
* WYSIWYG screen editing in the Unity 2D scene editor
* Passing objects as parameters between screens and popups
* Top bar for use in Free2Play-based games that need 25 different currencies


Also includes DOTween for some simple menu transition animations.


Tested working on 5.6.4f1
